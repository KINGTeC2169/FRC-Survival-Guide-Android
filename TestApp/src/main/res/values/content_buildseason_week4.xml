        <item>Getting Started Programming</item>
        <item>In order to test your robot, you need to be able to control it. Start with the basics,
            and begin programming one subsystem at a time. It is important to remember that you
            shouldn\'t worry about perfecting the code at this time; save the fine-tuning and control
            loops for later. As long as you can control the subsystems at this point, and are able to
            read from any sensors that you might have, you\'re doing fine.</item>
