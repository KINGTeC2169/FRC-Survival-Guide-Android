        <item>Prototyping</item>
        <item>The teams on Einstein Field at the FRC World Championship consistently do one thing right.
            They test and test repeatedly, designing and breaking components of their robot before even
            thinking about assembling them into a finalized design. Prototyping allows teams to find
            flaws in their designs and fix them before it cuts into the crucial later weeks, where time
            and resources need to be spent on programming and drive practice.
            &lt;br>
            KING TeC assembles smaller two/three man teams that work on individual components of the
            robot. How you prototype is up to your team, but it is important to keep the process moving.
            Don\'t let a failure in one part constitute a failure as a whole!</item>

        <item>Building the Chassis</item>
        <item>Although you may not have a completely finalized robot design at this point in time, it is
            extremely important that you begin building the chassis. The drive-train is the heart of almost
            every robot design out there, and it is important to get a driving robot as soon as possible. Not
            only will having driving robot guarantee you some level of success on the field, without a
            frame the components and modules you are prototyping will have nowhere to go!</item>

        <item>Drive Practice</item>
        <item>When competing at competition, nothing can make or break your teams experience than how
            your drivers work together and with the robot. While six weeks is not a lot of time to build
            a robot, it is important to find time to let your drivers practice. The earlier the better,
            but the season goes fast and we often are only able to practice driving during the last few
            days of the build season.</item>
