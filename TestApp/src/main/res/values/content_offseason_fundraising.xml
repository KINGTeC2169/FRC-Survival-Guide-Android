        <item>Obtaining Sponsors</item>
        <item>Sponsorships often give teams large amounts of money for little effort,
            especially when compared to other methods of fundraising. Sponsors can be either
            corporate, at a major business such as JCPenny, or local, with locations that include
            a local hardware store and a restaurant. However, when obtaining sponsors it is
            important to remember that non-monetary sponsorship may be just as valuable as money.
            Many companies can offer mentorship or supply donations.
            &lt;br>The first step to getting sponsors is asking team members if any parents work for
            companies that could potentially offer money, mentors, or donations to the team. This
            option should be explored first because connections make companies much more likely to
            want to support the team. Ask the  parents for the people to contact regarding
            sponsorship at their companies, and call the contacts to schedule meetings with those
            who grant sponsorship. Once a meeting is scheduled, sponsorship is almost guaranteed.
            Prepare an interactive PowerPoint and speech, and be ready to answer questions.
            &lt;br>If no parents work at companies that could sponsor the team or additional
            sponsors are needed, there are many other options. Go to the websites of local teams and
            find out which companies sponsor them, as large companies usually sponsor several teams
            in their base areas. Local companies are also often willing to sponsor robotics teams.
            Although they might not be able to give as much money, having support from the community
            is an important aspect of FIRST.

        <item>Applying for Grants</item>
        <item>Grants typically offer a one-time source of money for teams. The monetary
            amount, however, is rarely small. FIRST offers grants to its teams, but many of
            these are aimed towards and only eligible to rookie teams. Many corporations
            offer several grants to both rookie and veteran teams. At this time, these companies
            include NASA, Rockwell Automation, and PTC. Local educational foundations and
            donation-based non-profit organizations also often offer grants. When applying for
            grants, a team may apply for a general team grant or for a grant for specific, needed
            items. An example of items to buy with grant money, which may be stated when
            applying for the grant, is the purchase of computers, hard drives, and tablets.</item>

        <item>Major Fundraising Events</item>
        <item>One reliable and consistent way to raise money is to host large fundraising events. These
            events often span several days of work and should be planned well in advance. Although a lot
            of work, these events provide an excellent way to raise funds for your team.
            &lt;br>One example of a major fundraising event is hosting a summer day camp for
            local youth. This doubles as an outreach activity because FIRST supports the introduction
            of STEAM (Science, Technology, Engineering, Art, and Mathematics) in community outreach
            to young people. Teams can charge anywhere from $50 to $250 per student for a one or two
            weeklong day camp. There are many options of concepts to teach the attending students,
            and these include MIT’s Scratch programming and robots built with Vex or FLL kit-of-parts.
            Teams can either host these camps themselves at their high school or at other community
            locations, and local “community education” groups can run and manage the camps.
            &lt;br>Teams can host school-sponsored activities to raise both money and local awareness.
            Planning and holding a themed school dance should raise anywhere from $1,000 to $5,000 per year.
            Examples of themes are winter, Valentine’s Day, and Halloween. Robotic concepts such as
            laser lights and automated decorations can even be incorporated into the dance. Students
            will be drawn to attend the dance with promotions that students DJ the music and there are
            fun, unique elements such as balloon drops.
            &lt;br>Hosting an off-season regional competition spreads awareness of the team and earns
            money. Prices to charge per attending team range from $50 to $500, and this adds up
            quickly if 20+ teams attend. Teams return continually to well-organized events because
            they provide positive networking environments for both the hosts and attendees. If a
            team is small or new to planning an event of such a large magnitude, it can team up with
            one or two other local teams and split the profits.</item>

        <item>Minor Fundraising Events</item>
        <item>Smaller fundraising events may raise less money, but they are easier to plan and host
            more of. Many successfully spread awareness in a team’s local community. One example is
            bagging groceries at a local supermarket. Past robots can be displayed and, if the store
            allows it, driven. Customers are usually excited to hear about the robots and community
            outreach of a FIRST team, and they are often willing to donate. This typically earns a
            team $500 to $1,500. Another small fundraising event that can be done at a supermarket
            is selling hot dogs outside the building in the summer. Local stores will often donate
            the equipment, and they will possibly donate the supplies. Watch for stores that offer
            this, and request a shift. This can make a team around $500 to $1,000. Many local and
            chain restaurants offer high school teams benefit nights. On these nights, a certain
            percentage of sales is granted to the promoted team. If a team advertises properly, it
            has the potential to earn well over $500 and into the thousands of dollars. When
            combined, these minor fundraising events can earn more money than one or two major
            events.</item>
