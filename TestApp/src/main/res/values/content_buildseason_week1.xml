        <item>Brainstorming</item>
        <item>Leaving Kickoff, the first thing your team should begin doing is
            brainstorming. No idea is a bad idea here, and this is the time to come up with all kinds of
            crazy designs. During this time you should begin planning strategy and deciding how and what
            you want your robot to do.</item>

        <item>Approaching the Game</item>
        <item>Before thinking about how your robot could accomplish the
            game, it is important for you to decide what you want to accomplish! You\'ll need a
            game-plan before you can design a robot. In order to design a robot around the best
            strategy, KING TeC stages a mock game using human players instead of robots immediately
            after Kickoff, revealing any strategies that may otherwise be overlooked.</item>

        <item>Game Rules</item>
        <item>Fully understanding the rules of the new game is critical to the design
            process. Everyone on the team should read the rules at least once and your team should
            appoint a Rules Master, someone who your team can defer to for all rules-related questions.</item>

        <item>Getting Materials</item>
        <item>While the details of your design may not be set in stone, it is important for your
            team to begin purchasing materials, especially materials that need to be shipped.
            Unfortunately you can\'t build a robot without supplies, and it is much better to be
            waiting for them during Weeks One and Two than during Week Six.
            &lt;br>Have your team put together a list of expected materials, and don\'t forget to
            include extras for any parts you think might break.
            Your priority should be getting the parts you need to start building!</item>
