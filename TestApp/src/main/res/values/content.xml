        <item>Leaving Kickoff, the first thing your team should begin doing is
            brainstorming. No idea is a bad idea here, and this is the time to come up with all kinds of
            crazy designs. During this time you should begin planning strategy and deciding how and what
            you want your robot to do.</item>

        <item>Approaching the Game</item>
        <item>Before thinking about how your robot could accomplish the
            game, it is important for you to decide what you want to accomplish! You\'ll need a
            game-plan before you can design a robot. In order to design a robot around the best
            strategy, KING TeC stages a mock game using human players instead of robots immediately
            after Kickoff, revealing any strategies that may otherwise be overlooked.</item>

        <item>While the details of your design may not be set in stone, it is important for your
            team to begin purchasing materials, especially materials that need to be shipped.
            Unfortunately you can\'t build a robot without supplies, and it is much better to be
            waiting for them during Weeks One and Two than during Week Six.
            &lt;br>
            Have your team put together a list of expected materials, and don\'t forget to
            include extras for any parts you think might break.
            Your priority should be getting the parts you need to start building!</item>

        <item>Prototyping</item>
        <item>The teams on Einstein Field at the FRC World Championship consistently do one thing right.
            They test and test repeatedly, designing and breaking components of their robot before even
            thinking about assembling them into a finalized design. Prototyping allows teams to find
            flaws in their designs and fix them before it cuts into the crucial later weeks, where time
            and resources need to be spent on programming and drive practice.
            &lt;br>
            KING TeC assembles smaller two/three man teams that work on individual components of the
            robot. How you prototype is up to your team, but it is important to keep the process moving.
            Don\'t let a failure in one part constitute a failure as a whole!</item>

            extremely important that you begin building the chassis. The drive-train is the heart of almost
            every robot design out there, and it is important to get a driving robot as soon as possible. Not
            only will having driving robot guarantee you some level of success on the field, without a
            frame the components and modules you are prototyping will have nowhere to go!</item>

            a robot, it is important to find time to let your drivers practice. The earlier the better,
            but the season goes fast and we often are only able to practice driving during the last few
            days of the build season.</item>

        <item>Getting Started Programming</item>
        <item>In order to test your robot, you need to be able to control it. Start with the basics,
            and begin programming one subsystem at a time. It is important to remember that you
            shouldn\'t worry about perfecting the code at this time; save the fine-tuning and control
            loops for later. As long as you can control the subsystems at this point, and are able to
            read from any sensors that you might have, you\'re doing fine.</item>

        <item>fragment_pager_item</item>
        <item>Programming</item>
        <item>By this point, you should be able to control every part of your robot. It is time to
            stop working on implementing new features and perfect the ones you have. This is the time
            to create control loops which make the driver\'s job easier, such as a PID controller.
            Make sure to check if existing functions are available before trying to implement your
            own; they will be easier to use and are much less likely to contain bugs than code you or
            your team writes.
            &lt;br>
            One of the features that is not stressed enough in FRC programming is code reuse.
            When writing the functions for this year\'s robot, think about how you can write the code
            so that it is still viable next year. Although your robot will change from year to year,
            there is no reason you cannot recycle some of the programming ideas and implementations.
            However, you may be required to release the code as open-source if you plan to use code
            from previous years, in order to comply with
            &lt;a href="http://frc-manual.usfirst.org/viewItem/285">R16&lt;/a> of the

        <item>While you hopefully have the main functionality of your robot programmed by this point,
            odds are you won\'t get everything perfect the first time. Your programmers should be focusing
            on fixing the major bugs and getting everything working, but after that it is time to bring
            in the drive team.
            &lt;br>
            Although programmers like to think they know everything about the robot,
            it is important to remind them that they most likely won\'t be driving it at competition.
            If they will be, your team has lucked out! If not, the programmers should sit down with the
            drive team and fine tune the controls until the drivers are content.</item>

            &lt;br>
            You are allowed to bring a small amount of robot-related parts to competition, which means

        <item>Team Image</item>
        <item>Before competition it is important to develop a team image or look. This look can be
            fun and exciting; teams wear everything from animal costumes to capes and crowns, each
            team coming up with their own look. It can be difficult to make your own image, but just
            keep in mind that it doesn\'t have to be crazy to be recognizable. As winners of the FIRST
            World Championship Imagery Award, KING TeC shows that you don’t have to look over the top
            for your team to stand out.
            &lt;br>
            Start with a team t-shirt. Make your team name and number easily read, this way if another
            team or a judge is looking for your team, you’re easy to find. After developing a shirt, the
            sky is the limit. Teams wear everything from matching shoes, to matching bracelets. Be creative
            and remember to not shy far from your name. If teams will wonder how your mascot is relevant to
            your name, it’s probably not the best idea.</item>

            bracelets. Swag gets your team name and number out to other teams. Continue to keep in

        <item>Obtaining Sponsors</item>
        <item>Sponsorships often give teams large amounts of money for little effort,
            especially when compared to other methods of fundraising. Sponsors can be either
            corporate, at a major business such as JCPenny, or local, with locations that include
            a local hardware store and a restaurant. However, when obtaining sponsors it is
            important to remember that non-monetary sponsorship may be just as valuable as money.
            Many companies can offer mentorship or supply donations.
            &lt;br>The first step to getting sponsors is asking team members if any parents work for
            companies that could potentially offer money, mentors, or donations to the team. This
            option should be explored first because connections make companies much more likely to
            want to support the team. Ask the  parents for the people to contact regarding
            sponsorship at their companies, and call the contacts to schedule meetings with those
            who grant sponsorship. Once a meeting is scheduled, sponsorship is almost guaranteed.
            Prepare an interactive PowerPoint and speech, and be ready to answer questions.
            &lt;br>If no parents work at companies that could sponsor the team or additional
            sponsors are needed, there are many other options. Go to the websites of local teams and
            find out which companies sponsor them, as large companies usually sponsor several teams
            in their base areas. Local companies are also often willing to sponsor robotics teams.
            Although they might not be able to give as much money, having support from the community
            is an important aspect of FIRST.

        <item>Applying for Grants</item>
        <item>Grants typically offer a one-time source of money for teams. The monetary
            amount, however, is rarely small. FIRST offers grants to its teams, but many of
            these are aimed towards and only eligible to rookie teams. Many corporations
            offer several grants to both rookie and veteran teams. At this time, these companies
            include NASA, Rockwell Automation, and PTC. Local educational foundations and
            donation-based non-profit organizations also often offer grants. When applying for
            grants, a team may apply for a general team grant or for a grant for specific, needed
            items. An example of items to buy with grant money, which may be stated when
            applying for the grant, is the purchase of computers, hard drives, and tablets.</item>

        <item>fragment_pager_item</item>
        <item>Major Fundraising Events</item>
        <item>One reliable and consistent way to raise money is to host large fundraising events. These
            events often span several days of work and should be planned well in advance. Although a lot
            of work, these events provide an excellent way to raise funds for your team.
            &lt;br>One example of a major fundraising event is hosting a summer day camp for
            local youth. This doubles as an outreach activity because FIRST supports the introduction
            of STEAM (Science, Technology, Engineering, Art, and Mathematics) in community outreach
            to young people. Teams can charge anywhere from $50 to $250 per student for a one or two
            weeklong day camp. There are many options of concepts to teach the attending students,
            and these include MIT’s Scratch programming and robots built with Vex or FLL kit-of-parts.
            Teams can either host these camps themselves at their high school or at other community
            locations, and local “community education” groups can run and manage the camps.
            &lt;br>Teams can host school-sponsored activities to raise both money and local awareness.
            Planning and holding a themed school dance should raise anywhere from $1,000 to $5,000 per year.
            Examples of themes are winter, Valentine’s Day, and Halloween. Robotic concepts such as
            laser lights and automated decorations can even be incorporated into the dance. Students
            will be drawn to attend the dance with promotions that students DJ the music and there are
            fun, unique elements such as balloon drops.
            &lt;br>Hosting an off-season regional competition spreads awareness of the team and earns
            money. Prices to charge per attending team range from $50 to $500, and this adds up
            quickly if 20+ teams attend. Teams return continually to well-organized events because
            they provide positive networking environments for both the hosts and attendees. If a
            team is small or new to planning an event of such a large magnitude, it can team up with
            one or two other local teams and split the profits.</item>

        <item>Minor Fundraising Events</item>
        <item>Smaller fundraising events may raise less money, but they are easier to plan and host
            more of. Many successfully spread awareness in a team’s local community. One example is
            bagging groceries at a local supermarket. Past robots can be displayed and, if the store
            allows it, driven. Customers are usually excited to hear about the robots and community
            outreach of a FIRST team, and they are often willing to donate. This typically earns a
            team $500 to $1,500. Another small fundraising event that can be done at a supermarket
            is selling hot dogs outside the building in the summer. Local stores will often donate
            the equipment, and they will possibly donate the supplies. Watch for stores that offer
            this, and request a shift. This can make a team around $500 to $1,000. Many local and
            chain restaurants offer high school teams benefit nights. On these nights, a certain
            percentage of sales is granted to the promoted team. If a team advertises properly, it
            has the potential to earn well over $500 and into the thousands of dollars. When
            combined, these minor fundraising events can earn more money than one or two major
            events.</item>
