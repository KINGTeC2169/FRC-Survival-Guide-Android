        <item>Building Modules</item>
        <item>Hopefully by now prototyping has shown you some viable strategies and mechanisms for
            the game. Prototypes are great for finding out what designs work well, but your robot should
            not be made of prototypes! It\'s time to start building modules out of the designs you have
            tested; even if not every component has been fully tested it is important to start
            building what you can as soon as you can!
            &lt;br>While building components in modular sections is often the most efficient workflow,
            where many people can work on assembly at once, it is important to remember that in the
            end every module must come together to form a robot. Don\'t forget to talk between
            work-groups to make sure that everybody is on the same page!</item>

        <item>Starting Electrical</item>
        <item>Although it may seem absurd to start designing your electrical configuration without a
            complete robot, you\'re going to want to have the main board designed and built early so
            it can be installed on the chassis. Try to have all of your main electrical components in
            one place, so that parts can be swapped out if need be.
            &lt;br>Even though the electrical system is often designed to fit in a small, compact space
            it is important to not get carried away and create an impermeable board. Every electrical
            component on your robot will generate heat, and the last thing your team needs is part of
            the robot shutting down during competition from overheating. Consider ventilation when
            designing your system!
            &lt;br>Labelling parts of the system is also a critically important step; one which can
            never be started too early. If your team\'s main electrician is absent on competition day,
            would your team be able to fix any problems that arose?</item>
