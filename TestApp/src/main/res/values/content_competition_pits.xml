        <item>Pit Design</item>
        <item>Designing your pit is one of the most important things to do before you head to
            competition. Creating your pit is not something to take lightly considering it
            represents your team in the pits at competitions. There are many different aspects to
            consider when designing your teams pit. One main thing to think about is implementing
            your team\'s name and number into your pit. Your name and number should be clearly visible
            to everyone whether they are judges, other team members/mentors, or volunteers; it is
            very important that your pit is noticeable to all of these people.
            &lt;br>The design of your pit is also supposed to not only display your teams name and
            number but also your teams theme and values. Judges are constantly in the pits so it is
            important that your team’s values are displayed openly. This can be shown by hanging up
            posters, displaying your sponsors names, or even banners. Hanging a banner across the
            top of your pit is an easy way to display a lot of information that can easily be seen
            by everyone. As you can see, there are many ways to show your teams theme and values in
            your pit design. The best advice we can give is to have fun and be creative!</item>

        <item>Organization</item>
        <item>Organization is one of the most important things in your team’s pit. Without a system
            of organization it is almost inevitable that you will lose something. There are many
            different ways to organize your pit. You will have a ton of tools and items you will be
            bringing with you that will all seem to end up in your pit. It is a good idea to have
            boxes, cabinets, etc. so items are not lost or stolen. Organizing your pit crew\'s tools
            is a vitally important thing for your team’s success because if your robot breaks during
            competition you want to be able to find these tools easily. It is also important to leave
            tools that are commonly needed during competition in a close by place so they can be accessed easily.
            &lt;br>Aside from the tools there are many other things that will need to be organized
            in your pit whether they are computers, batteries, or even jackets. It is a good idea
            to have an easily accessible area with the batteries so you can quickly change them when
            necessary. Computers are not something you likely want to leave out in the open, even if
            there is someone always in your pit, it is best to put them in a safe place such as a
            cabinet or even just under a table out of site. Jackets and other such items can easily
            be put into a box or crate so they are not taking up space inside the pit. Lastly, always
            remember to leave space to work when needed.</item>

        <item>Pit Crew</item>
        <item>The pit crew are some of the most crucial people off the field. It is important to
            allow them the space necessary in the pit for immediate work and for those moments of
            rushed panic. The pit crew should be ready for anything at any time. The crew should be
            about 5-6 people so there is not too few or too many people in the pits. The pits can
            easily get crowded so it is important to not have too many people around so there is
            plenty of space to work on the robot. With the drive team and the pit crew constantly
            in and out of the pits it’s important to keep a minimal amount of people besides them in
            the area to avoid overcrowding. A last reminder, it is very important to have mechanical
            people in the pit crew, but a programmer is just as necessary for a successful robot.</item>

        <item>Talking With Judges</item>
        <item>Talking with judges is obviously one of the most important parts of the pits. Judges
            are constantly walking through the pits at competitions so don’t forget to always show
            gracious professionalism. When judges come and talk to teams in the pits they are truly
            curious and eager to learn about your team and your robot. The judges will ask questions
            that are either relevant to your robot or your team so it is wise to have experts of both
            in your pits. When talking to judges always be informative. It is also important that
            when judges come to your team’s pit that a team member is doing most or all of the
            talking, not a mentor or parent. The judges are there to talk to the team, not the
            mentors.
            &lt;br>While the majority of the questions asked in the pit will be about your team\'s
            robot the judges will also be looking for contenders for the other awards at the
            competition. This will be even amplified if you are competing for the Chairman\'s award.
            It is important to have an expert on your team’s outreach, marketing, and fundraising
            side of your team in the pits as well. They will help answer these questions for the
            judges. Judges are also not the only ones coming to talk in the pits; you will have pit
            scouters, alliance partners, and volunteers always coming by also. Remember to always
            be in a good mood!</item>
