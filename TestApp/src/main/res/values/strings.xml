    <string name="brainstorming">Leaving Kickoff, the first thing your team should begin doing is
        brainstorming. No idea is a bad idea here, and this is the time to come up with all kinds of
        crazy designs. During this time you should begin planning strategy and deciding how and what
        you want your robot to do.</string>
    <string name="approaching_the_game_title">Approaching the Game</string>
    <string name="approaching_the_game">Before thinking about how your robot could accomplish the
        game, it is important for you to decide what you want to accomplish! You\'ll need a
        game-plan before you can design a robot. In order to design a robot around the best
        strategy, KING TeC stages a mock game using human players instead of robots immediately
        after Kickoff, revealing any strategies that may otherwise be overlooked.</string>
    <string name="game_rules_title">Game Rules</string>
    <string name="game_rules">Fully understanding the rules of the new game is critical to the design
        process. Everyone on the team should read the rules at least once and your team should
        appoint a Rules Master, someone who your team can defer to for all rules-related questions.</string>
