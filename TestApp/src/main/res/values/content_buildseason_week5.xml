        <item>By this point, you should be able to control every part of your robot. It is time to
            stop working on implementing new features and perfect the ones you have. This is the time
            to create control loops which make the driver\'s job easier, such as a PID controller.
            Make sure to check if existing functions are available before trying to implement your
            own; they will be easier to use and are much less likely to contain bugs than code you or
            your team writes.
            &lt;br>
            One of the features that is not stressed enough in FRC programming is code reuse.
            When writing the functions for this year\'s robot, think about how you can write the code
            so that it is still viable next year. Although your robot will change from year to year,
            there is no reason you cannot recycle some of the programming ideas and implementations.
            However, you may be required to release the code as open-source if you plan to use code
            from previous years, in order to comply with
            &lt;a href="http://frc-manual.usfirst.org/viewItem/285">R16&lt;/a> of the
