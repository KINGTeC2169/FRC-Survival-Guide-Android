        <item>Programming</item>
        <item>By this point, you should be able to control every part of your robot. It is time to
            stop working on implementing new features and perfect the ones you have. This is the time
            to create control loops which make the driver\'s job easier, such as a PID controller.
            Make sure to check if existing functions are available before trying to implement your
            own; they will be easier to use and are much less likely to contain bugs than code you or
            your team writes.
            &lt;br>
            One of the features that is not stressed enough in FRC programming is code reuse.
            When writing the functions for this year\'s robot, think about how you can write the code
            so that it is still viable next year. Although your robot will change from year to year,
            there is no reason you cannot recycle some of the programming ideas and implementations.
            However, you may be required to release the code as open-source if you plan to use code
            from previous years, in order to comply with
            &lt;a href="http://frc-manual.usfirst.org/viewItem/3#removeid_700">R13&lt;/a> of the
            &lt;a href="http://frc-manual.usfirst.org/viewItem/3">Game Manual&lt;/a>.</item>

        <item>Practicing Driving</item>
        <item>Driving the robot at competition is an incredibly stressful job, and one that no amount
            of practice can fully prepare you for. In addition, no two robots are exactly the same, so
            experience driving from previous years will not always transfer. By Week 5 your team should
            have enough of a robot working to at least be driving, and ideally your team is completely
            done building and the robot is programmed.
            &lt;br>By setting up a makeshift field your drivers should be able to get a feel for both
            the robot and the game. If your team has old robots available, try pitting the new one
            against a ragtag defense. This will give you an idea of what your robot is and isn\'t capable
            of doing. Don\'t forget to try and practice scoring!</item>
